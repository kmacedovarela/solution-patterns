.. Check the *Include all branches* to ensure the github pages are deployed correctly.
.. Enter your repository name (e.g. `solution-pattern-xyz`) and a description
.. Choose an appropriate *Owner* (your personal account or one of your organizations). Once you're ready to publish your first version, you can move or fork the repository into the https://github.com/redhat-solution-patterns[redhat-solution-patterns] organization. 
.. To avail of github pages to publish your documentation, keep the repository as *Public*.
.. Click on *"Create repository"*;

. In a few seconds your repo will ready for use. 

== 2. Building and Running the project

Next, let's build and run the project on development mode. 

. Clone the *new* repository to your local machine using `git clone` from your local CLI.
+
[TIP]
You can rely on hot-reload features during your development; therefore, you'll save time validating your implementation's output results.
. In a terminal, navigate to your project's repository;
. Build and start the project with:
+
[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
```
npm install
npx gulp
```
+
. A new page should open on your browser pointing to http://localhost:3000/solution-pattern-template/index.html[]
